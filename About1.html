       <center><h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to
        be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.It is often 
        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
        and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides
        a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using 
        angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page. Other
        tags such as  and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling
        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
        MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, 
        and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide 
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity 
        and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
        between the pages that share the file and its formatting. </h2>
